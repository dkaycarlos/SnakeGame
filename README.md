# SnakeGame
Basic Snake Game in C++ (That's mostly finished)

***Make sure to press LSHIFT to end the game (under caps lock)**

Known bugs:
- Netbeans can sometimes hang since it's all in a while loop, and pressing LSHIFT properly breaks the while loop
- The snake head will move slightly faster when you hold up or down.
